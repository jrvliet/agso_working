The introductory undergraduate astronomy classes have labs attached to them, and those labs are run by grad students. The Head TA is a graduate student assigned to ensure that those teaching labs have all the information they need. However, in general before you teach a lab, it's good practice to work through it by yourself. We have a copy of the 105 Lab manual online as a <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/astro/">PDF</a>. In addition to just knowing the answers, it helps to know where students tend to make mistakes. In this page we've compiled all of the advice we give each other about each lab. If you want to add something, please <a href="mailto:jrvander@nmsu.edu">email the webmaster</a>.

<h2>1) Intro Lab</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>This lab is a run-through of the math the students will encounter through the semester, like powers, unit conversion, and scientific notation. They don't like doing this lab, but it becomes a handy reference for them throughout the year. Give an example of how to work a problem in each section, so your students start off right. This lab doesn't have point values assigned to it, since it is intended only to be a review.
</p>
  <p>
Since this is the first lab, it's a good idea to take time for some house-keeping: hand out your <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, give them the URL for your class website, remind them to buy their lab manual if they haven't already. You will probably need a few extra copies of this lab for people who don't yet have their manual. Mention what assignments you expect from them: group labs, individual summaries, campus observatory, observing projects (if assigned). Also mention what you expect from them as far as quality of work (e.g. not showing work, not writing units, crappy summaries).</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Roberto wrote nice examples of a <a href="goodsummary.pdf">good summary</a> and a <a href="badsummary.pdf">bad summary</a>.</li>
<li>Liz provides an example of a <a href="SampleObservSheet.pdf">well-done observatory sheet</a>.</li>
</ul>
  <strong>Please talk about plagiarism</strong>, especially how even if the information is on Wikipedia (or in the lab manual) it is not okay to copy and use that as a summary. The <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/index.html">NMSU Student Code of Conduct</a> has a section on <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/misconduct.html">academic misconduct</a>. If you suspect plagiarism, keep a copy of the assignment and of the website/book/etc. showing the original work (for your own protection). Talk to the student <strong>immediatly</strong> about the nature of the offense (eg, switching words around does not make the sentence your own work) and the consenquences (zero for the question/assignment/class).
  <p>If your professor hasn't already assigned lab groups, you might have to <a href="teachout.html#groups">do it yourself</a>.</p>
  <p>Scientific notation is trickier for the students than you think, especially when the number is negative, and will bring out some creativity in some students. Since students aren't familiar with the metric system, they will get confused by table 1.1. Give them a few basics to get a grip on: 1000m = 1km; 100cm = 1m; 10mm = 1cm. Also, decimal format for time may confused them, and they will think 2.33 hr is 2 hr and 33 min.
</p><p>
Students sometimes get hung up on scale length on a map versus the real length that represents. The questions about the map will come back to haunt them in other labs, like Moon, Terrestrial Planets, and Sun. When figuring out which city had a higher average temperature, it helps to point out that they don't have to actually calculate an average for each city --- just looking at their graphs will give them the answer.
</p>
<p>
For some reason the students really want to cross-multiply when we show them how to do unit conversion, instead of multiplying across the top, the bottom. Watch out for that 'cos it's a sneaky trick. It is a good idea to go over unit conversion in the beginning, anyway. If they can do the following, they'll be set for most of the labs:
<img src="images/unitconversion.gif" width="273" height="30" align="center" />
</p>
Some students will have real calculators, which is great, but they won't necessarily know how to use them, which is not so great. They don't understand order of operations and assume that the calculator will know what it is supposed to do. You might need either to explain how to use parentheses on the calculator or just how to plug numbers in properly. Unfortunately, this will haunt you throughout the semester.

<a name="seasons"></a>
<h2>2) Seasons</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>In theory this lab will teach students why the Earth experiences seasons. If you're curious, before you start the lab, poll your students to find out how many believe seasons are caused by the Earth's distance from the Sun. The setup is involved for this lab, so either Tom or the Head TA will help you set up the lab stations You will need the extension cords, and they should be at the bottom of the first metal shelf in the Bx102 closet. It is important to set up the lamps 1.5m from the globes, or they don't illuminate the globe properly. For Bx102, this means the lamps are set up at one end of each table and the globe at the opposite end. Unfortunately, there's an issue of "light pollution": light from one group's lamp will shine on the globe of another group, making it harder to see the day/night terminator. Solutions have ranged from making a paper collar for the lamps to group members holding up notebooks to shield their globes.
</p>
<p>
Exercise #1 has the students measuring out a scale version of the aphelion and perihelion distances to the Sun. They do this with tape on the table. Make sure they measure the distances both side by side, so it is easier to compare them. Watch out when they are measuring the diameter of the Sun in the pictures. Make sure they measure the diameter of the Sun rather than a chord. You might want to remind your students that an ellipse has a major and minor axis.
</p>
<p>
If you read the lab, you may notice that exercise #2 can be done entirely at home. If you want to save some lab time, ask your students to do it beforehand, if you think they actually will.
</p>
<p>In the Elevation Angle/Sunlight Concentration section, the students measure the major and minor axes but actually require the semi-major and semi-minor axes for their calculation. Make sure students don't confuse diameter and radius! Some people don't understand that the angle of the light is due to how high the Sun gets in the sky, so this part of the lab may seem stupid to them. Also, some students get confused and think that there's more energy per unit area in low elevations because the ellipse has a larger area than the circle.
</p>
<p>Part of the lab is done with the globes and the light source. Make sure the light is level with and aimed at the globe's equator and that it is the correct distance from the globe. They have to do many arc length measurements. A suggestion to speed this up is that the students measure the circumference of the globe at the four places marked. Then all they need to do is measure the day side lengths and calculate the dark side measurements, instead of having to measure both. Make sure the students don't confuse their tables and fill in the wrong one. Oh, yeah, the students may have trouble converting from arc length to length of day. Another suggestion is to split up the class: have the whole class do the first orientation (perpendicular), then half the class do Northern Summer and half do Northern Winter.
</p>
<p>If you think the students will take a long time, you can switch it so they do the flashlight-elevation part before doing the globe part. That way they won't freak during the globe part (which takes a while), thinking they still have a whole other section to do.

<h2>3&amp;4) Phases of the Moon</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>It helps to draw a diagram like the below image. Malynda scanned in the <a href="images/MoonPhase.jpg">version she uses</a>. As you fill it out, explain why we see what phase we do and why we know the rise-peak-set times. Be careful: your students will start to think that at midnight the moon is always full. Work through the different phases and where the Moon is first; then, once they understand that, go back and explain the times of day. Make sure to mention why we know East is on the left and West is on the right for the diagram; otherwise, if you change the orientation of the diagram they will be lost.
</p>
<img src="images/moon_phases_diagram.jpg" width="550" height="475" />
<p>Do lots of examples like exercises 4, 5, 6, and most of your students should get it.
</p>
<p>
Cat likes to point out that changes in phase go from right to left (in the Northern hemisphere): as phases progress, light comes in on the right and moves across the disk until it's full, then darkness comes in on the right and moves across the disk until it's new. She notes that this is because astronomy is backward (true, true).</p>

<h2>5) Kepler's Laws</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>This lab helps the students visualize Kepler's laws of planetary motion using a computer program. The CDs with the Kepler software are stored in the server room (Rm 118), typically on the shelf with the other DVDs and tapes. Groups larger than 3 students are not good for this lab, since that leads to one or two people doing the work while the rest sit around getting bored.
</p>
<p>
Since this is a computer-based lab, you will have to use one of the computer labs on campus, and we typtically use Jacobs 129. <strong>Reserve the computer room way in advance of your lab</strong> using the <a href="http://ict.nmsu.edu/scs/room_request.htm">ICT lab reservation request form</a>, and make sure either you or the Head TA checks to ensure the software still works on the computers (sometimes we have issues when ICT does software updates). If you have a Windows laptop and want to play around with the software, you may need to put the <a href="threed32.ocx">threed32.ocx</a> file in your C:\Windows\system folder. If the program doesn't work at all, you can try using java applets as backups:  </p>

<p>
You should go over the laws (and the law of gravity) in your intro lecture. This is a long lab to do and to grade. Stay on top of your students so they finish on time; if they goof off they'll end up needing an extra half hour. Groups of five or larger are unwieldy for this lab, so have your students break into smaller groups if you need to.
</p><p>
Explain exercises 1 and 2 but suggest doing them last. They can do them at home if they run out of time. Be warned, the students don't visualize the sum of the distance to the foci staying constant, even with the imagery of the colored arrows. They'll say something like 'the blue arrows get shorter and then longer' to describe what happens.
</p>
<p>
The instantaneous velocity equation, <font color="#0000ff">V=SQRT( (<font color="#ff0000">G(M+M)</font> / (2/r - 1/<font color="#ff0000">a</font>) )</font>, really confuses the students. Remind them that they will set <font color="#ff0000">a</font> and <font color="#ff0000">G(M+M)</font> equal to 1 and then solve for <font color="#0000ff">V</font> when <font color="#0000ff">r=0.5</font><font color="#ff0000">a</font> for perihelion and when <font color="#0000ff">r=1.5</font><font color="#ff0000">a</font> at aphelion. Some students just don't know how to do this, but other students get it creatively wrong: they set <font color="#ff0000">a</font> and <font color="#ff0000">G(M+M)</font> equal to one, but then they stick in <font color="#0000ff">r=0.5</font><font color="#ff0000">a</font> and don't know what to do with <font color="#ff0000">a</font>.
</p><p>
In the past, some machines only accepted mass-ratio values less than one, whereas others accepted anything. For the problem with m<sub>1</sub>=4 and m<sub>2</sub>=1, q=0.25 was a safe bet, as opposed to q=4. For finding the value of q "at which larger values cause the planet to 'stay home,'" Give them a range to search in and suggest an increment to step through it, otherwise they have no clue where to start.
</p>
<p>Alternately, you can use the <a href="keplerslaws.pdf">non-computer Kepler's Laws lab</a> that Jillian wrote. You will need some supplies for the lab, though:  string, tape, thumbtacks, and 8.5x11&quot; pieces of cardboard. Students completed this lab in 1.5 - 1.75 hours.</p>

<a name="mercury"></a>
<h2>6) Orbit of Mercury</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
  <p> Please go through this lab entirely before you teach it; you do not want to do this on the fly. This lab has students draw a fairly accurate representation of Mercury's orbit using only a humble protractor. Why do we bother? </p>
  <ol>
    <li>It's awesome that they can get so close to the actual orbital parameters using only a protractor</li>
    <li>We can show students how we know orbital shapes even when we can't pan out of the solar system and see orbit tracks laid out in space</li>
    <li>We can also show students that astronomy is tough but do-able</li>
    <li>We're evil (students usually only believe this one)</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Demonstrate how to graph Mercury's position </strong>either by using the document projector or by showing them Nikki's awesome pre-lab lecture (<a href="mercurylecture.ppt">9.3MB PPT</a> also works moderately well in OpenOffice). Do this for a few positions, so they get the hang of it. Cat created an excellent <a href="Orbit_drawing.pdf">cheat sheet</a> for drawing the orbit. There is a copy of a blank orbit and extra copies of Cat's cheat sheet in the Master Copy Binder in the Bx102 closet. Make extra copies if you need it. In fact, bring a few extra copies with you, just in case; you can always donate 'em to the next person to do the lab.</p>
  <p>It helps the students if everyone draws their own orbit, rather than one person drawing it per group. No one is sitting around bored and they can pick the best orbit for their lab calculations. Students can confuse Earth and Mercury angles, and they get confused about flipping the protractor for Eastern and Western elongations.     It might help your students if  they go through and draw all of their Earth positions first (and <strong>label each one with the elongation number</strong>), then  draw all of the Eastern elongations, and then  draw all of the Western elongations. Check each group's first few Earth points to make sure they're doing it correctly. One wrong point will send them into crazy orbit land.</p>
    <p><img src="images/Candace_orbit_mercury.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />Students don't always make the connection between an elongation angle and the top-down view of the orbital setup. Candace created a wooden model which might help them grasp this. Students can put Mercury at various points in its orbit and see how far it would appear from the Sun from Earths' point of view (<a href="images/Candace_orbit_mercury_explanation.jpg">example</a>).</p>
  <p>Also, the students won't have had much practice using protractors. Explain that angles are measured with the vertex in the little circle of the protractor. Emphasize that the angle they will be measuring is from the normal (whatever number of degrees from 90<sup>o</sup>), rather than going by the number written on the protractor (e.g. measuring 30<sup>o</sup> to the left means making a mark at 60<sup>o</sup> rather than 30<sup>o</sup>). </p>
  <p> Some students don't understand why we convert from measuring the semi-major axis in millimeters to AU. They will continue to use their measurement in millimeters for the calculations, and consequently get really weird numbers.</p>
  <p> Make sure you write on the board the accepted values for the orbit of Mercury: </p>
  <div style="margin-left:20px;"> period 87.969 days<br />
    semi-major axis 0.387 AU<br />
    eccentricity 0.2056 </div>

<h2>7) Scale Solar System</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>To save some confusion, have your students do all of the calculations in beginning. When everyone is done, they can lay out the solar system. It helps keeps students sane if you point out the "entry" button (2nd - enter on most TI calculators) on their calculators, which makes the repetitive calculations much easier and cuts down on errors. Mike created a nice explanation of conversion calculations in PDF and HTML formats.
If students ask why Neptune and Pluto don't collide, one of the reasons is because of Pluto's orbital inclination. When Pluto is at its closest to the Sun, it would be around 22 yards above the football field. At its farthest point, it'd also be around 26 yards underground. The other planets are roughly coplanar, and don't travel more than 1 yard above/below the field. See here for more details.
</p>
Fun facts:
<ul>
<li>On the same scale, Proxima Centauri is about 386 miles away...or 30 miles north of Taos. The Great Andromeda galaxy is ~2.5 AU away.</li>
<li>Proxima is also about as far away as Phoenix. Alpha Cen A is a little bigger than the Sun and Alpha Cen B is a little smaller. If the Sun is a nickel, then Alpha Cen could be thought of as a quarter, a penny, and a (something slightly larger than Jupiter).</li>
<li>At this scale, the speed of light is about 1 inch every 5.5 seconds. To imagine sending communications from Earth to a spacecraft, you might picture it as being sent by "messenger ant". If you had a spacecraft at Pluto, it would take over 5 hours for your message to reach it, plus that same time for its response to get back to you - be it "okay, I'll do that" or "what?".</li>
</ul>

<h2>8) Density</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>
Make sure your students double check the mass of the golf ball. If they use a 20g ball and think they're using 10g, they will end up with golf balls which should float on water. Also, they need to measure the mass of their lava before measuring volume. If they do it the other way around, the lava will soak up water and mess up their mass measurements.</p>

<h2>9) Density of the Earth</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>
Take shadow measurements a few days before lab at the same time as you'll be doing them in lab so you know what numbers they should be getting and can make up Boulder numbers if necessary.</p>
<p>
A good website for calculating the sun's elevation angles is <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/AltAz.php">http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/AltAz.php</a>.  This site gives elevation angle, which is 90 minus the angle the lab requires.  The students measure the LC shadow, and you'll have to tell them the Boulder shadow length (which you can calculate from the angles from that website).  I use meter sticks and chalk for this.  When calculating circumference from their shadow lengths, make sure everyone's calculators are in DEGREE mode and make sure everyone understands the difference between TAN and ATAN.  The earlier labs should get an Earth circumference of ~41,000km.  The later labs will probably get an answer in the 50,000's.</p>
<p>
To calculate acceleration due to Earth's gravity, there are stop watches, water balloons, and tennis (or other) balls in BX.  If you use water balloons, please clean up afterward.  Most students get 10-12 m/s^2 for acceleration (fall times of ~1.2s).  Make sure you get the penthouse key AND the roof key from Ofelia ahead of time (she takes lunch break from noon to 1p).  The penthouse is currently Reta Beebe's office.  Email her ahead of time and let her know you'll be accessing the roof from her office. (She is very friendly, and she thinks this lab is great, so she probably won't give you any trouble.)</p>
<p>
The whole point of the lab is to fill out Table 3.  These are the rough answers (orders of magnitude):
<div style="margin-left:20px">
Radius: 6-7x10<sup>6</sup> m <br />
Mass, 10<sup>24</sup> kg <br />
Volume, 10<sup>21</sup> m<sup>3</sup> <br />
Density, 10<sup>3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> or 5-8 gm/cm<sup>3</sup></p>
</div>
<p>
Even if students are terrible at measuring shadows and timing falling objects, they usually get the right orders of magnitude for this table.  CHECK THEIR ANSWERS -- if they're wrong, it usually means they typed something into their calculators wrong.  This is the usually the first lab where they have to deal with scientific notation on a calculator, and some (or most) students don't know how to type it in (or they use 'e' instead of 'E').</p>
<p>
Questions 2 and 3 of the in-lab are essentially the same.  Explain Q2 on the board -- write the equation for circumference and then walk through how the circumference changes (does it increase/decrease) if the LC angle increases.  After you establish that C increases, ask them what happens to R (increases).  Write the equation for density (in terms of R -- the mass equation is given in the lab).  Mass has an R^2 dependency, and volume goes as R^3.  Ask them what this simplifies to (density ~ 1/R).  Since we already established that R increases, ask them what happens to density (decreases).</p>
<p>
For the take home, 1-1.5 pages is usually sufficient (check with the other TAs so everyone requires the same length).  For potential errors -- the Eratosthenes method is most accurate if the shadows are measured at local noon on the summer solstice at 23.5 lat so that one city has no shadow.  Since that's not available to us, doing it at local noon (which is around 1.30p if you're in DST) is the best you can do.  This was one of the intended answers for the questions about potential errors.  However, that's beyond most students' capabilities.  More common answers include not holding the meter stick straight, marking the shadow wrong, clouds interfering with shadow measurements, human reflex times affecting the stopwatch measurements.
</p>

<!--<p>
Make sure your students understand the process they're going through by stepping through the equations on the board. Watch out for conversion confusion: the equation for estimating Earth's mass has a factor of 1000 to convert from meters to kilometers, but the students must remember to divide their final density value by 1000 to convert to gm/cm3. Give them orders of magnitude for mass, volume, and density so they know if they're completely wrong. Make sure calculators are in degree mode. Explain exactly what to do with the meter sticks and stop watches before going outside. Chalk is helpful with measuring shadows. Make sure they put their shadow measurements in the take home table, NOT table 1.
</p>
<p>
If you don't have water balloons to drop, you can use sports balls from the BX 102 closet.

<h2>12) Surface of the Moon</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>This is a binder lab meant to familiarize students with the appearance of the Moon, some surface geology, and how astronomers date solar system surfaces. You'll want to explain about crater impacts and dating and how maria form.
For the first questions, the approximate number of craters is fine. The students don't have to spend half the lab counting all the craters.</p>
<p>
This lab is full of scale-distance map questions, which may trip up your students. Remember the intro lab questions about the map? Here's where it will bite you. When calculating area of a mountain on the moon, make sure they convert image distance to real distance first and then multiply to get area. Watch out with image scale: not every image uses the same scale, but the students will calculate a scale for one image and then try to use it for the rest of the images in the lab.</p>
<p>
Regarding the landing sites for the NASA missions, question 6 is the same as question 5. Cat suggests omitting Q6 and making Q5 worth 10 points.</p>
<p>
There is a question where they are giving the size of the crater Tycho and told to measure the distance to the crater Clavius in a highliy inclined view of the Moon's surface. To measure the distance to Clavius properly, they must scale the image by measuring the width of Tycho in the same direction as they will measure distance ... meaning, scale the image across the minor axis of the crater. If the image were not inclined at all, this wouldn't be a problem; but students don't seem to understand that scaling the image by measuring the major axis of the crater and then measuring a distance along the minor axis is wrong.</p>

<p>As a rough approximation using Google maps, the Organ mountains are about 200 km<sup>2</sup> and NMSU campus is about 6 km<sup>2</sup>. It's hard to get a feel for the scale of the images, so Jillian offers the following comparison for the Copernicus crater:

<a name="terrestrial"></a><h2>13) Introduction to the Geology of the Terrestrial Planets</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>This is a binder lab where the students look at a lot of pictures and compare planet surfaces. They should get an idea of what can change the surface of a planet: cratering, geologic activity (volcanic or techtonic), and erosion/weathering. There is no math in this lab, so you will have happy students!
</p>
<p>
You will need to explain the difference between shield and composite volcano types. It's helpful to remind the students of the possible resurfacing agents: erosion (wind and water), tectonic activity (recycling continents), and volcanic activity (lava flows).
</p>
<p>
Students are given topographic maps and asked to comment on which planet has the most relief. You may have to explain that 'relief' refers to texture of the surface, that a low relief surface is smooth and a high relief surface is rough/ragged/structured.
</p>
<p>Students are asked to comment on water-carved features. They get confused with the different colors shown, where water is a muddy brown and land is a dark blue. Also, in one picture there  are clouds with dark shadows, and students sometimes think these are islands.</p>
<p>
Question 20 asks about teardrop shapes around craters and how that might indicate the presence of water; they won't get it. Help them visualize how water would flow around the crater, creating an eddy downstream where more sediment would be deposited, resulting in a teardrop shaped mound.

Don't confuse dendritic and anastomosing: the former means 'having a branched form resembling a tree' (like leaf veins) and the latter 'cross-connecting between adjacent channels, tubes, or fibers' (like an intertwined rope). Also, make sure the students know which is Warrego and Ares Valles. If they confuse the two, their answers will be wrong.
</p>
<p>
Explain how normal people use transparencies and the thin sheets of paper that go underneath when they're done. When measuring length and width, make sure they use the images, not the pattern they traced on the transparency. They will forget to multiply by 100 to get water volume from dirt volume.

Explain what's going on with the IR and visible cameras: the IR camera had much worse resolution, so the pixels were huge compared to the visible camera. A large chuck of the text that explains how to fill out the table is wrong. Completely wrong. Most students don't read it, but some do and more chaos ensues.

Students can get confused with the same quantity having difference values with different units. Suggest to your students that they convert to degrees Fahrenheit last, so they don't use the wrong temperature value to get the other temperature values.

<h2>17) Comets</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>This is the fun lab. Don't wear black.
</p>
<p>
This lab is to familiarize students with the small (leftover) bodies in the solar system. You may want to show them the department's meteorites (which are huge); they're kept in a metal toolbox in Ofelia's office. It's nice to show some pictures of comets, to explain the orbits and morphology, and of asteroids, for comparison. Make sure they understand about the different populations of objects, relating to solar system formation. Otherwise, they walk away thinking that asteroids are dead comets (e.g. when comets run out of ice and gas, their orbits shift and circularize them to the asteroid belt). Emphasize that tails form only when the comet is near the Sun and why. You can link the importance of understanding comets to the beginning of life on Earth, as handy delivery packets of water and seeds of life (<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17628-found-first-amino-acid-on-a-comet.html">amino acids on Comet Wild 2</a>, <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/asteroid-collision-meteoroid-amino-acids-life-101215.html">amino acids on asteroid 2008 TC3</a>,

<p>While they wait to make a comet, the students will drop ball bearings into flour to simulate cratering on the Moon. They're supposed to measure the size of the crater produced by a small and large ball from various heights. Measuring the crater size can be tricky, as is setting up the flour for the best impact.  This is as messy as it looks. If you lay down paper around the flour bins, you can catch most of the flour by folding them up and throwing them away. You can also try taping sheets together to make a cylinder, which you can put on top the flour to prevent the ejecta from escaping the bin.</p>

<p>To simulate the effects of solar irradiation on the comets, you can either grab the overhead projector from Ay119 or use a desk lamp (from the Seasons lab setup) and a hair dryer  (the hair dryer is in the closet, in the cabinet labeld 'comet lab'). You put the comet on the projector/shine the desk lamp on it and use a hair dryer to simulate the solar wind. You do get some nice illumination of outgassing. This may leave a bit of a mess on the projector or the table, so please remember to clean up when you are done. </p>
<p>
Section 4.3 has a question about dropping your comet and a rock on the ground and noting what happened to each one. This question is printed at the beginning of the lab, but the students don't drop the objects until the end. People often forget it's there, so remind them to answer it and get full credit.

<h2>19) The Sun</h2>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>This is mostly a binder lab. Make sure you have answers on hand, for students find the most interesting ways to make mistakes.
There is no way to avoid it: students get confused when subtracting times. Just ... be patient. As you know and love from the intro lab, there are scale distance to real distance conversions in this lab. Some of your students will still be confused by the fact that the image scale changes for each image.  Keep reminding them that they need to use the size of the Sun to figure out the scale of each image (they conveniently contains either the whole Sun or half of the Sun). A backup of the images is kept <a href="images/sun/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Please explain how images of the Sun are taken with a coronograph. We've noticed that when asked to measure the extent of the corona students measure the black disk of the coronograph instead of the light around the Sun.
</p>
<img src="images/sunlabcorona.jpg" width="324" height="253" />
<p>
If your lab is during the day, you can use the solar telescopes to show the students the Sun. These telescopes filter out some 99.9% of the light and have an H-alpha filter. To point the telescope at the Sun, it's easiest to look at the shadow of the frame. The frame is longer than it is thick, so when you minimize the size of the shadow it must be pointed close to the Sun. A small white dot will appear on the circular finder scope, which you can center to get the Sun in the eyepiece. You can tune the wavelength a little around H-alpha by turning the barrel clockwise and counter-clockwise. The focus is changed using the silver knob underneath the eyepiece. Check <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/">SpaceWeather</a> to see if the Sun has any sunspots the day of your lab. </p>
<p>
If your lab is at night, or it's cloudy, you can use the electromagnet to demonstrate the shape of a dipole magnetic field. Students can experiment by pouring iron filing in the white trays and placing a magnet under the tray. If they put it in the tray, they have to clean the damned filings off it themselves.
</p>
<p>
The Sun rotates every 25 days at the equator and takes progressively longer to rotate at higher latitudes:<br />
25 days @ equator<br />
27 days @ 35<sup>o</sup><br />
33 days @ 75<sup>o</sup><br />
35 days @ 90<sup>o</sup><br />

This lab is new to rotation and is still being ironed out. It will be introduced to the lab manual in the Fall of 2015. It is written by Ethan Dederick, so if you find inconsistancies or have suggestions, please let him know. If you do this lab, please send in your comments! What follows are suggestions from Ethan.

This lab is a little different from some of the other labs, because you get to walk the students through the lab as an entire class rather than releasing them to do tasks in their groups. The calculations will be done in their individual groups, but the class collaborates quite a bit. The tricky part of this lab is having the students actually do the calculations. There will be some math that some of them may not have seen before. For example, they have to use a log when calculating a magnitude. This isn't a math lesson, just do one example and show them where the log button is on their calculator.
</p>
<p>
The lab is computationally intensive to begin with, but I recommend moving through that as quickly as possible so that much time remains for discussion about the flyby and lander images.
</p>
<p>
REMEMBER: This lab is also different in that the class can go several different directions. There is no right or wrong system/planet to investigate so the students do have freedom to investigate the planets they would like to.

<p>
As far as the orbital images go, do not show the students the Climatemap image as those were not generated correctly; do not show them the Noisemap unless they are interested in noise in data; the Mergemap is the actual map of the surface; Nightmap is the surface at night; the Heightmap is the elevation of the surface (NOTE: white is higher elevation, black is lower); do not show them the Embossmap unless you would like to-it only reveals surface detail a bit sharper but at the expense of the color of the image.
